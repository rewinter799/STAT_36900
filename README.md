# STAT_36900

Assignments from STAT 36900 (Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis), taught by Dr. Don Hedeker, at UChicago.

* Homework 1 introduces mixed effects models for studying longitudinal data, as well as best practices for covariate selection.
* Homework 2 continues to explore the use of mixed effects models, but this time in the presence of time-varying covariates.
* Homework 3 contrasts mixed effects models with covariance pattern models (CPMs) and provides a case study in the covariance selection process.
* Homework 4 contrasts mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for studying binary outcomes (i.e., logistic regression).
* Homework 5 uses mixed effects models to study ordinal outcomes (i.e., ordinal logistic regression / cumulative logit models / proportional odds models).
